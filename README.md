I personaly think JavaScript is really cool but it's basic objects, like Strings or Arrays, lake of utility methods.

This script simply add methods to object prototypes for an easier and more comprehensible JavaScript source code.

Examples:

You have already asked yourself how to capitalize a String ?
In JavaScript we do this like: 
```this.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.slice(1)``` 

Way too long and not very comprehensible right ? 

JSExtends lets you do exactly the same with: ```my_string.capitalize()```
